    <li>We will look at this video that explains it very well <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPkEqOoQSu4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPkEqOoQSu4</a></li>
    <li>Server virtualization uses software-based partitions tocreate multiple virtual servers— called virtual machines—on a single physical server.</li>
    <li>The major benefit of this system is that each server no longer has to be dedicated to a particular task. Instead, multiple applications can run on a single physical server, with each application running within its own software environment.</li>
    <li>As a result, virtualization enables companies to increase server utilization. In addition, companies realize cost savings in two areas. First, they do not have to buy additional servers to meet peak demand. Second, they reduce their utility costs because they are using less energy.</li>
