<div class="modal-body modal-fixed-height">
  <ul>
    <li>Concern 1: Legacy IT Systems-</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Historically, organizational IT systems have accumulated a diversity of hardware, operating systems, and applications. When bundled together, these systems are called “legacy spaghetti.” These systems cannot easily be transferred to the cloud because they must first be untangled and simplified.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Concern 2: Reliability</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Example: Amazon Web Services</li>
    </ul>
    <li>oncern 3: Privacy- Privacy advocates have criticized cloud computing for posing a major threat to privacy because the providers control, and thus lawfully or unlawfully monitor, the data and communication stored between the user and the host company.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The point is that customer data may not remain on the same system or in the same data center. This situation can lead to legal concerns over jurisdiction</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Concern 4: Security- Critics also question how secure cloud computing really is.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Because the characteristics of cloud computing can differ widely from those of traditional IT architectures, providers need to reconsider the effectiveness and efficiency of traditional security mechanisms.</li>
      <li>Security issues include access to sensitive data, data segregation (among customers), privacy, error exploitation, recovery, accountability, malicious insiders, and account control.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Concern 5: The Regulatory and Legal Environment- There are numerous legal and regulatory barriers to cloud computing, many of which involve data access and transport.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>For example, the European Union prohibits consumers’ data from being transferred to nonmember countries without the consumers’ prior consent and approval.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
