    <p>Cloud Computing- Today, organizations and individuals can use the power of cloud computing.</p>
    <li>cloud computing provides access to a shared pool of computing resources, including computers, storage, applications, and services, over a network, typically the Internet.</li>
  </ul>

<h4>Cloud computing motivation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Traditional IT departments spend huge amounts on both IT infrastructure and the expert staffs they need to build and maintain complex IT systems.</li>
  <li>Despite all of this spending, however, organisations typically do not use their infrastructure to its full capacity. The majority of these expenses are typically applied to maintaining the existing IT infrastructure, with the remainder being allocated to developing new systems.</li>
  <li>Companies are being buried under vast amounts of data</li>
  <li>Traditional IT departments are struggling to capture, store, manage, and analyze all of these data. As a result of these problems, traditional IT infrastructures can actually inhibit an organization’s ability to respond quickly and appropriately to today’s rapidly changing business environments.</li>
  <li>Large organisations may be able to afford the above mentioned set-up, but it becomes very hard for small- to-medium level organisations.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is Cloud computing?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The seller has actual energy-consuming servers which host products and services from a remote location, so end-users don't have to; they can simply log on to the network without installing anything.</li>
  <li>These cloud services may be offered in a public, private or hybrid network.</li>
  <li>Google, Amazon, IBM, Oracle Cloud, Salesforce, Zoho and Microsoft Azure are some well-known cloud vendors.</li>
