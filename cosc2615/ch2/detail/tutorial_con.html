  <p><b>1. Would a professional IT person have rules of conduct?</b></p>
  <li> yes<br>
“professional” means belonging to a profession, and usually being a member of a professional body, like the ACS in Australia, or the ACM or IEEE.<br>
These bodies have codes of ethics, which cover rules of conduct.<br><br>
Some ethicists believe that all professionals, regardless of their practice, have special moral obligations as professionals. From Ch 4 (Tavani 105)</li>
<br>
  <p><b>2. What about an IT organisation, would it have rules of conduct specified?</b></p>
  <li>
    Not all IT companies consider themselves as professional.  Those which do, have codes of ethics and rules of conduct, explicitly written.  Those which don’t, may have “understood” rules.<br>
From Tavani, “because software engineers and their teams are responsible for developing safety-critical systems, they have significant opportunities to
  <ul>
  <li>do good or cause harm,</li>
  <li>enable others to do good or cause harm, </li>
  <li>influence others to do good or cause harm.”</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <br>
  <p><b>3. Working in a group of two to three, choose any two of the following key concepts-</b></p>
  <li>
    • Rights,     what you are entitled to … through job, by birth, through payment.<br>
• Obligations,    what you should do, for family, for company, for country<br>
• Duty,   care, jobs and roles you should perform<br>
• Self-interest,   greed, improvement of your own conditions, qualifications usually at the expense of others<br>
• Responsibility,  expectations of you <br>
• Avoiding harm. <br>
Would these concepts be important to your professional life?  How?  All are important for professional life and have a bearing on your success.
  </li>
  <br>
  <p><b>4. Explain the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic values</b></p>
  <li>Intrinsic value: Values such as life and happiness are intrinsic because they are valued for their own sake.
Eg no price for life, or happiness.<br>
Anything with a price is instrumental…eg money is instrumental.<br>
“Value “ has been derived from the latin valere, which means having worth or being of worth.<br>
Extrinsic or Instrumental value: Any value that serves some further end or good is called an instrumental value because it is tied to some external standard. <br>
 Automobiles, computers, and money are goods that have instrumental value. <br>
<br><br>
Later we will see that utilitarian argue that happiness is an intrinsic value. And later in the chapters some ethicists believe that personal privacy is a value that has both intrinsic and extrinsic attributes. James Moor believes that life happiness and autonomy are the core values because they are basic to society’s thriving and perhaps even to its survival.
</li>
  <br>
  <p><b>5. What might be some core values of an IT organisation?</b></p>
<li>
  Check ACS code of ethics….<br>

  Whatever is written in an organisation’s mission statement should reflect their core values.<br>
  http://www.changed.co.nz/articles/COREVALUES.pdf<br>
  teamwork, honesty, excellence, commitment, ownership, personal development.

  <p><b>6. A lot of businesses track the employee movements via the use of sophisticated surveillance
systems.<br>
Consider this from a deontological point of view, and discuss how this might fit in with an organisation’s core values, if the CEO considered themselves a Utilitarian.</b></p>
<li>
  Consider this from a deontological point of view, and discuss how this might fit in with an organization’s core values, if the CEO considered themselves a Utilitarian.
  Deontological theories are built around duty
  Deontological ethics or deontology is the normative ethical position that judges the morality of an action based on the action's adherence to a rule or rules.[1] It is sometimes described as "duty" or "obligation" or "rule"-based ethics, because rules "bind you to your duty."<br>
  Business people know that time is money and this time employees “wasted” on the internet costs US businesses approximately $63 billion a year. <br>
  Many employers feel they have the right to monitor employees because they are being paid to perform certain duties, and the amount of dollars wasted hurts the company.<br>
  Another consideration is that companies are the owners of the office equipment and therefore have the right to specify how those resources are used. Accordingly, as owners of these business tools “if the company has reason to believe that an employee is using its resources inappropriately, or to its determinant, the company has a right and a obligation to protect itself”<br>
  Supporters of employee surveillance will also argue that employers have a right to see what their workers are doing throughout the day. Performance levels are much more attainable which allows for companies to work more efficiently. Many companies track keystroke accuracy, e-mail use, destination of phone calls, web site hits, and employee movement throughout the building to measure the productivity of individual employees.1<br>
  One final motivation for intruding on employee privacy is in the interest of protecting a third party. This entity could be customers, shareholders, suppliers, creditors, neighbors to the workplace and others. Since corporations are liable for their employee’s behavior such consideration seems justifiable. These arguments are valid and it is agreed that some level of surveillance is necessary to regulate business operations.
<br><br>
  A Utilitarian’s view: <br>
  What would be the consequences of tracking the movements of employees?<br>
  Firstly, the company is able to ensure that the all workers are fully accounted for and that they are always doing their jobs. This will in turn reap higher revenues for the company as they are maximizing the use of their employees’ working hours. For example, if a worker is to unlawfully take an additional hour of break, the revenue that the company can potentially earn from that hour of work will be lost.<br>
  Secondly, the customers of the company are able to receive a better service and faster response. By being able to track the location of their workers, companies are able to deploy and dispatch the workers more effectively by sending the worker nearest to the location of the customer to them. This will again reap higher revenues for the company as this increases the efficiency of the workers and more customers will be attracted to the company due to the better and faster services provided. The customers will also benefit from the better and faster services provided.<br>
  Perhaps the only negative consequence will be that the privacy of the employee is infringed by the constant tracking.<br>
  Thus, from the act utilitarianism point of view, more people will derive benefit from the use of the application to track the location of workers and thus it is right to do so.

  <p><b>7. What is meant by cloud computing?</b></p>
  <li>
    Cloud computing provides access to a shared pool of computing resources, including computers, storage, applications, and services, over a network, typically the Internet. <br>
    Cloud Computing is computing that involves a large number of computers connected through a communication network such as the Internet, similar to utility computing. In science, cloud computing is a synonym for distributed computing over a network, and means the ability to run a program or application on many connected computers at the same time. The term “cloud” is a metaphor for the Internet.
  </li>
<br>
  <p><b>8. What are some current concerns about cloud computing?<br>
Consider these concerns from a utilitarian point of view, and discuss how this might fit in with an organisation’s core values, if the CEO considered themselves a Deontologist.</b></p>
<li>
  Traditional IT departments are struggling to capture, store, manage, and analyze all of these data. As a result of these problems, traditional IT infrastructures can actually inhibit an organization’s ability to respond quickly and appropriately to today’s rapidly changing business environments. <br>
  ■Large organizations may be able to afford the above-mentioned set-up, but it becomes very hard for small- to-medium sized organizations.<br>
  Concern 1: Legacy IT Systems- <br>
  ■Historically, organizational IT systems have accumulated a diversity of hardware, operating systems, and applications. When bundled together, these systems are called “legacy spaghetti.” These systems cannot easily be transferred to the cloud because they must first be untangled and simplified. <br>
  ■Concern 2: Reliability<br>
 ■Example: Amazon Web Services <br>
  Concern 3: Privacy- Privacy advocates have criticized cloud computing for posing a major threat to privacy because the providers control, and thus lawfully or unlawfully monitor, the data and communication stored between the user and the host company. <br>
  ■The point is that customer data may not remain on the same system or in the same data center. This situation can lead to legal concerns over jurisdiction <br>
  Concern 4: Security- Critics also question how secure cloud computing really is. <br>
  ■Because the characteristics of cloud computing can differ widely from those of traditional IT architectures, providers need to reconsider the effectiveness and efficiency of traditional security mechanisms. <br>
  Security issues include access to sensitive data, data segregation (among customers), privacy, error exploitation, recovery, accountability, malicious insiders, and account control. <br>
  Concern 5: The Regulatory and Legal Environment- There are numerous legal and regulatory barriers to cloud computing, many of which involve data access and transport. <br>
  ■For example, the European Union prohibits consumers’ data from being transferred to nonmember countries without the consumers’ prior consent and approval. <br>
<br>
  Consider these concerns from a utilitarian point of view, and discuss how this might fit in with an organization’s core values, if the CEO considered themselves a Deontologist. <br>
  An individual act (X) or a social policy (Y) is morally permissible if the consequences that result from (X) or (Y) produce the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of persons affected by the act or policy. <br>
  Utilitarians draw on two key points in defending their theory: <br>
  ■(i) the principle of social utility should be used to determine morality; <br>
  ■(ii) the belief that social utility can be measured by the amount of happiness produced.
