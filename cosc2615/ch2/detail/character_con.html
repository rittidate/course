  <ul>
    <li>Cloud Computing Provides On-Demand Self-Service: A customer can access needed computing resources automatically.</li>
    <li>Cloud Computing Encompasses the Characteristics of Grid Computing</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Grid Computing enables organizations to utilize resources more efficiently</li>
      <li>Grid Computing provides fault tolerance and redundancy</li>
      <li>Grid Computing makes it easy to scale up</li>
      <li>Grid Computing makes it easy to scale down</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Cloud Computing Encompasses the Characteristics of Utility Computing</li>
    <ul>
      <li>In utility computing, a service provider makes computing resources and infrastructure management available to a customer as needed. The provider then charges the customer for its specific usage rather than a flat rate. Utility computing enables companies to efficiently meet fluctuating demands for computing power by lowering the costs of owning the hardware infrastructure.</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Cloud Computing utilises Broad Network Access- The cloud provider’s computing resources are available over a network, accessed with a Web browser, and they are configured so they can be used with any computing device.</li>
    <li>Cloud Computing Pools Computing Resources- The provider’s computing resources are available to serve multiple customers. These resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned according to customer demand.</li>
    <li>Cloud Computing Often Occurs on Virtualized Servers</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Server Farms</li>
      <li>Server Virtualization – this requires some explanation.</li>
    </ul>
