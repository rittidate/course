<ul>
  <li><b>Public Cloud-</b> are shared,easily accessible, multi-customer IT infrastructures that are available nonexclusively to any entity in the general public (individuals, groups, and/or organizations). Public cloud vendors provide applications, storage, and other computing resources as services over the Internet. These services may be free or offered on a pay-per-usage mode. Example- Movirtu</li>
  <ul>
    <li>is a cloud-based phone service that allows people to manage their own mobile network accounts—phone number, voice mail, texting, etc.—without ever owning a phone or a SIM card. Movirtu prices its service with lower-income users in mind, and it shares its profits with the mobile network carriers.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Private Clouds-</b> are IT infrastructures that can be accessed only by a single entity or by an exclusive group of related entities that share the same purpose and requirements, such as all of the business units within a single organisation.</li>
  <li><b>Hybrid Clouds-</b> are composed of public and private clouds that remain unique entities but are nevertheless bound together, thereby offering users the benefits of multiple deployment models. Hybrid clouds deliver services based on security requirements, the mission-critical nature of applications, and other company- established policies. For example, customers may need to keep some of their data in a private cloud for security and privacy reasons while storing other, less-sensitive data in a public cloud because it is less expensive</li>
  <li><b>Vertical Clouds-</b> It is now possible to build cloud infrastructure and applications for different businesses— the construction, finance, or insurance businesses, for example—thus building vertical clouds (see www.vertical- cloud.com)</li>
