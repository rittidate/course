      <li>Stand-alone Personal Computers- In the late 1970s, the first personal computers appeared. The IBM PC’s debut in 1981 legitimized the entire personal computer market. Users began bringing personal computers to the workplace to improve their productivity—for example, by using spreadsheet and word processing applications.</li>
      <li>Local Area Networks (Client/Server Computing)- When personal computers are networked, individual productivity is substantially increased. For this reason, organizations began to connect personal computers into local area networks (LANs) and then connect these LANs to the mainframe, a type of processing known as client/server computing.</li>
