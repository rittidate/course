    <h3 class="modal-title">Debate about the Uniqueness of Cyberethics Issues</h3>
</div>
<div class="modal-body modal-fixed-height">
  <ul>
    <li>There are two points of view on whether cybertechnology has generated any new or unique ethical issues:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>1. Traditionalists argue that nothing is new â€“ crime is crime, and murder is murder.</li>
      <li>2. Uniqueness Proponents arguethat cybertechnology has introduced (at least some) new and unique ethical issues that could not have existed before computers.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Both sides seem correct on some claims, and both seem to be wrong on others.</li>
    <li>Traditionalists underestimate the role that issues of scale and scope that apply because of the impact of computer technology.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>For example, cyberbullies can bully multiple victims simultaneously (scale) and globally (because of the scope or reach of the Internet).</li>
      <li>Cyberbullies can also operate without ever having to leave the comfort of their homes.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Proponents of the uniqueness thesis tend to confuse unique features of computer technology with unique ethical issues.</li>
    <li>Their argument is based on a logical fallacy:</li>
    <ul>
     <li><b>Premise.</b> Cybertechnology has some unique technological features.</li>
    <li><b>Premise.</b> Cybertechnology generates some ethical issues.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion.</b> (At least some of the) Ethical issues generated by cybertechnology must be unique.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Traditionalists and uniqueness advocates are each partly correct.</li>
    <li>Traditionalists correctly point out that no new ethical issues have been introduced by computers.</li>
    <li>Uniqueness proponents are correct in that cybertechnology has complicated our analysis of traditional ethical issues.</li>
    <li>So, in analyzing the issues involved in this debate, it is useful to distinguish between any:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>unique technological features;</li>
      <li>(alleged) unique ethical issues.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
