  <ul>
    <li>Additional ethical/social concerns associated with this evolution include controversies that are made possible by the following kinds of technologies:</li>
    <li>autonomous machines and sophisticated robots (used in warfare, transportation, care for the elderly, etc.);</li>
    <li>nanocomputing and nano-scale devices;</li>
    <li>artificial agents (including “soft bots”) that act on
    behalf of humans and corporations;</li>
    <li>AI-induced bionic chip implants (that can cause us to question what it means to be human vs. cyborg).</li>
