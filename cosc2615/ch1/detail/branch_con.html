  <ul>
    <li>Three distinct perspectives of applied ethics (as applied to cyberethics):</li>
￼    <ul>
      <li>Professional Ethics.</li>
      <li>Philosophical Ethics.</li>
      <li>Sociological/Descriptive Ethics.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</p>
  <h5>Perspective # 1: Cyberethics as a Branch of Professional Ethics</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>According to this view, the purpose of cyberethics is to identify and analyze issues of ethical responsibility for computer/information technology (IT)professionals.</li>
    <li>Consider a computer professional's role in designing, developing, and maintaining computer hardware and software systems.</li>
    <li>Suppose a programmer discovers that a software product she has been working on is about to be released for sale to the public, even though it is unreliable because it contains “buggy” software.</li>
    <li>Should she “blow the whistle”?</li>
  </ul>
