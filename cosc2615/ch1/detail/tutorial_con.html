    <li><b>1. How would you define an IT Professional?</b></li>
    <p>
      Broadly speaking, a computer/ IT professional is anyone employed in the computing and IT fields—from software and hardware engineers, to specialists such as support person- nel, network administrators, and computer repair technicians. Computer professionals can also include faculty and instructors who teach in computer science and information management departments at universities, as well as in industry settings. We could possibly even extend “computer/IT professional” to include professionals who are responsible for providing unfettered access to electronic information in libraries, although they may prefer to describe themselves as “information professionals” or “information science professionals.”
