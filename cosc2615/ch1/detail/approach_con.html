<div class="modal-body modal-fixed-height">
  <ul>
    <li><b>Step 1.</b> Identify a practice involving cyber-technology, or a feature in that technology, that is controversial from a moral perspective.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>1a. Disclose any hidden (or opaque) features or issues that have moral implications</li>
      <li>1b. If the ethical issue is descriptive, assess the sociological implications for relevant social institutions and socio-demographic and populations.</li>
      <li>1c. If the ethical issue is also normative, determine whether there are any specific guidelines, that is, professional codes that can help you resolve the issue (see Appendixes A-E).</li>
      <li>1d. If the normative ethical issues remain, go to Step 2.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Step 2.</b> Analyze the ethical issue by clarifying concepts and situating it in a context.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>2a. If a policy vacuums exists, go to Step 2b; otherwise go to Step 3.</li>
      <li>2b. Clear up any conceptual muddles involving the policy vacuum and go to Step 3.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Step 3.</b> Deliberate on the ethical issue. The deliberation process requires two stages:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>3a. Apply one or more ethical theories (see Chapter 2) to the analysis of the moral issue, and then go to step 3b.</li>
      <li>3b. Justify the position you reached by evaluating it against the rules for logic/critical thinking (see Chapter 3).</li>
    </ul>
