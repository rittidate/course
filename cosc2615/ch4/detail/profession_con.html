<ul>
  <li>Harris, Pritchard, and Rabins (2004) note that the term “profession” has evolved from a concept that was once associated with people professing a religious or monastic life to one that now has a more secular meaning.</li>
  <li>At one time, “profession” was used to describe a vocation where a person made a public promise to enter a “distinct way of life” with allegiance to “high moral ideals.”</li>
  <li>Later, the term came to refer to anyone who “professed to be duly qualified.”</li>
  <li>“Profession” has now come to mean an “occupation in which one professes to be skilled in and to follow.”</li>
  <li>Professionals who comprise a given profession also tend to have certain defining attributes and requirements.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>For example, medical doctors, lawyers, etc., often find themselves in situations in which their decisions and actions can have significant social effects; their roles and responsibilities can exceed those of ordinary individuals.</li>
