    <h3 class="modal-title">Why a Separate Category of Professional Ethics?</h3>
</div>
<div class="modal-body modal-fixed-height">
  <ul>
    <li>Arguably, the same ethical rules involving honesty, fairness, and so forth that apply to ordinary individuals should apply to professionals as well as.</li>
    <li>So, if it is wrong for ordinary people to steal, cheat, lie, and so forth, then it is wrong for professionals to do so as well.</li>
    <li>Why, then, is a separate field of study called "professional ethicsâ€œ needed?</li>
    <li>Some ethicists argue that professionals in some fields have special moral obligations that exceed those of ordinary individuals.</li>
    <li>Others ethicists argue that some of the moral issues affecting certain professions are sufficiently distinct and specialized to warrant a separate field of study.</li>
    <li>An adequate analysis of these arguments requires an understanding of what is meant by terms such as profession and professional.</li>
