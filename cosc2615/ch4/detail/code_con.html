  <h4>￼Professional Codes of Ethics</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Many professions have established professional societies, which, in turn, have adopted codes of conduct.</li>
    <li>In Australia, we have ACS (Australian Computer Society) for IT professionals.</li>
    <li>Its objects are "to advance professional excellence in information technology" and "to promote the development of Australian information and communications technology
  resources”</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>ACS Code of conduct case studies</h4>

  <br><br>
  <h4>Professional Codes for Computer/IT Societies</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The computing/IT profession also has other professional societies, which include:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The Association for Computing (ACM);</li>
      <li>The Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE);</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Professional codes of ethics are often designed to motivate members of an association to behave in certain ways.</li>
    <li>Four primary functions of codes are to:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>inspire</li>
      <li>guide</li>
      <li>educate</li>
      <li>discipline the members</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h4>￼In Defense of Professional Codes</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Gotterbarn argues that we need to distinguish among three aspects of professional codes, because they can function as:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>codes of ethics</li>
      <li>codes of conduct</li>
      <li>codes of practice</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Codes of ethics are "aspirational," because they often serve as mission statements for the profession and thus can provide vision and objectives.</li>
    <li>Codes of conduct are oriented more toward the professional and the professional's attitude and behavior.</li>
    <li>Codes of practice relate to operational activities within a profession.</li>
  </ul>

          <td>Codes educate the members of a profession about their professional obligations.</td>
          <td>A professional code’s directives are never complete or exhaustive.</td>

        <tr>
          <td>Codes discipline members when they violate one or more of the code’s directives.</td>
          <td>Codes are ineffective (have no “teeth”) in disciplinary matters.</td>

        <tr>
          <td>Codes “sensitize” members of a profession to ethical issues and alert them to ethical aspects they otherwise might overlook.</td>
          <td>Directives in codes are sometimes inconsistent with one another.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Codes inform the public about the nature and roles of the profession.</td>
          <td>Codes do not help us distinguish between micro-ethics issues and macro-ethics issues.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Codes enhance the profession in the eyes of the public.</td>
          <td>Codes can be self-serving for the profession.</td>
