</div>
<div class="modal-body modal-fixed-height">
<ul>
  <li>Many computer programming jobs in Australia are now being “outsourced” by major corporations to countries where programmers are willing to write the code for much lower wages.</li>
  <li>Not only does this practice raise questions for employee loyalty, but it could also affect the future of the computer profession in Australia</li>
  <ul>
    <li>What are your thoughts about this? Do you think organisations are ethical in doing so?</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Consider some examples of employer loyalty where an employer either:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>keeps an employee on the payroll even though that employee has a chronic illness, which causes her to miss several months of work.</li>
    <li>retains several employees, despite the fact that their medical conditions have caused the corporation's health insurance costs to increase significantly, thereby reducing the company's overall earnings.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>ANZ has been in controversy recently- “ANZ threatened to discipline pregnant worker over pelvic exam”- let us discuss the ethics of this very volatile case.</li>
