  <li>What, exactly, is whistle-blowing?</li>
  <li>Bok (2003) defines a whistle bloweras an individual who makes<br>
  “revelations meant to call attention to negligence, abuses, or dangers that threaten the public interest.”</li>
  <li>Bok notes that whistle blowers “sound an alarm” from within the organizations in which they work.</li>
  <li>She also notes that whistle blowing can be viewed as a form of dissent, because those who blow the whistle make public their disagreement with their employers or with some authority.</li>
  <li>While dissent can include all forms of disagreement (e.g., religious, political, etc.), whistle blowing has the “narrower aim of casting light on negligence or abuse, or of alerting the public to a risk.”</li>
  <li>In the context of engineering, whistle-blowing incidents often occur in attempts to alert the public to a potentially unsafe product.</li>
  <li>They can occur because of either:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>overt wrongdoing (where an employee informs the public about the immoral or illegal behavior of an employee or supervisor);</li>
    <li>negligence (e.g., where one or more individuals in an organization have failed to act).</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Should individuals in positions of authority in corporations such as Enron and WorldCom have blown the corporate whistle about the illegal accounting practices in those firms?</li>
  <li>One could argue that failing to blow the whistle in the Enron incident resulted in thousands of individuals losing their retirement savings, and in some cases their entire life savings.</li>
