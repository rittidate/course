<h4>Controversial Political Issues Involving Whistle-blowing</h4>
<ul>
  <li>"<b>SCENARIO 4–1:</b> Whistle-Blowing and the “Star Wars” Controversy<br>
In the early 1980s, a U.S. military proposal called the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) was introduced and debated. SDI, also referred to as “Star Wars” in the media, was a national missile defense (NMD) system that would provide a “defense shield” against incoming ballistic missiles. The SDI proposal, which was vigorously supported by the Reagan administration, soon became very controversial. While SDI’s supporters argued that the missile system was essential for America’s national defense, critics argued that the system’s software was unreliable. One critic, David Parnas, decided to go public with his concerns about SDI.20</li>
  <li>David Parnas blew the whistle on SDI because of three factors (Bowyer, 2001):</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The specifications for the software could not be known with any confidence.</li>
    <li>The software could not undergo realistic testing.</li>
    <li>There would not be sufficient time during an attack to repair and reinstall failing software (no "real-time" debugging).</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h4>When an Engineer is Permitted to Blow the Whistle</h4>
<ul>
  <li>In De George’s model, one is permitted to blow the whistle when the:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>harm that will be done by the product to the public is serious and considerable.</li>
    <li>engineers (or employees) have made their concerns known to their superiors.</li>
    <li>engineers (or employees) have received no satisfaction from their immediate supervisors and they have exhausted the channels available within the corporation, including going to the board of directors.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
