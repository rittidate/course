    <li><b>Proprietary software-</b> does not permit changes to the source code or redistribution. Proprietary software usually requires you to pay for it.</li>
    <li><b>Free Software -</b> comes with permission to redistribute and modify it. It can be free of charge ($0), or for purchase: the word ‘free’ refers to its use, not its price. (See for example the GNU system, which is ‘entirely free software’: http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-history.html)
    <br>Free Software is not to be confused with Freeware, which can relate to a variety of software categories, none of which come with the full ‘freedoms’ associated with free software.</li>
    <li><b>Shareware -</b> comes with permission for people to redistribute copies, but requires that anyone who continues to use a copy pays a licence fee.</li>
