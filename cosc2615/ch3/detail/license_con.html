</div>
<div class="modal-body modal-fixed-height">
􏰀  <ul>
    <li>A s/w license is a contract that allows one party (the end-user) to use the property of another (the programmer / developer / marketer) under certain conditions.</li>
    <li>A shrink-wrap license is sealed inside the s/w package. A notice warns the user that opening the package consents to the contract.</li>
    <li>A shareware license is usually in a doc. file; it says "using this software is consenting to the contract"</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Licensing Issues</h4>
  􏰀  <ul>
      <li>How can acceptance of the contract's offer be implied before all the terms are known ?</li>
      <li>The legal doctrine of privity of contract states a contract between two parties cannot be enforced by a 3rd party.</li>
      <li>If a contract is b/w programmer and end-user, how can the developer / marketer enforce it?</li>
      Shareware licensing has further problems :
      <li>When shareware is downloaded / used, users do not furnish any consideration, so is there a contract? Is a user obliged to register / pay?</li>
      <li>If a shareware license is invalid, then any warranty disclaimer is invalid, so can the programmer be sued by a user if the s/w causes damage ?</li>
      <li>If no license (contract), can shareware distribution only be prevented / limited by copyright ?</li>
    </ul>
