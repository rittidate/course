􏰀  <ul>
    <li>Tangible objects are exclusionary in nature.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>If Harry owns a laptop computer (a physical object), then Sally cannot, and vice versa.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>􏰀Intellectual objects, such as software programs, are non-exclusionary.</li>
    <ul>
      <li> If Sally makes a copy of a word-processing program (that resides in Harry's computer), then both Sally and Harry can possess copies of the same word-processing program.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The sense of scarcity that applies to tangible objects, which often causes competition and rivalry, need not exist for intellectual objects.</li>
    <li>There are practical limitations to the number of physical objects that one can own.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>There are limitations (natural and political) to the amount of land that can be owned.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Intellectual objects can be easily reproduced.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Countless copies of a software program can be produced – each at a relatively low cost.</li>
    </ul>
