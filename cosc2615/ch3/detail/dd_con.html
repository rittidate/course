<div class="modal-body modal-fixed-height">
Ùè∞Ä  <ul>
    <li>In Diamond v. Diehr, whose outcome was the result of a 5-4 decision, a patent was finally awarded for a computer program.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>In this instance, the program assisted in a process of converting rubber into tires.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Critics argued that Diehr had only a new computer program, since all of the parts of the machine used in the conversion process consisted of traditional technology except for the computer program.</li>
    <li>Although the Court ruled in favor of Diehr, the justices, in their decision, continued to affirm the view that computer algorithms themselves are not patentable.</li>
    <li>The Court pointed out that the patent awarded to Diehr was not for the computer program but for the rubber tire transformation process as a whole.</li>
