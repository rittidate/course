  <p><b>1. How would a professional IT person view property? Physical property, intellectual property</b></p>
  <li>Since most of the IT people writes software and this is sometimes redistributed, the most appropriate is to view it as intellectual property.</li>
<br>
  <p><b>2. Should computer programs be eligible for patent protection?
Or should they be protected by copyright law?
Or do they deserve both, or perhaps neither, kind of protection?
</b></p>
  <li>
    They can be protected by both, however, software is based on algorithms, and algorithms are not patentable unless they  are part of a bigger system that fulfills the patent requirements (usefulness, novelty and non-obviousness). Software can be  protected by copyright when meeting the requirements (original, non-functional and must be fixed in a tangible medium).
  </li>
  <br>
  <p><b>3. Working in a group of two to three, choose any two of the following property protection schemes-
    <ul>
      <li>Copyrights;</li>
      <li>Patents;</li>
      <li>Trademarks;</li>
      <li>Trade secrets.</li>
    </ul>
Would these concepts be important to your professional life?  How?

  <p><b>4. Explain what is meant by “fair use”?  How does this apply to reverse engineering?</b></p>
  <li>Fair use means that an author or publisher may make limited use of another person's copyrighted work for purposes such as criticism, education, research, etc. Fair use supports the practice of reverse engineering, allowing people to buy a product with the only purpose of taking it apart and see how it works.</li>
  <br>
  <p><b>5. What is meant by creative commons?  How could this affect an IT organisation?</b></p>
<li>
  Creative Commons (CC) is a non-profit organization headquartered in Mountain View, California, United States, devoted to expanding the range of creative works available for others to build upon legally and to share.The organization has released several copyright-licenses known as Creative Commons licenses free of charge to the public. These licenses allow creators to communicate which rights they reserve, and which rights they waive for the benefit of recipients or other creators (Wikipedia).
</li>
  <br>
  <p><b>6. What is the difference between copyleft and copyright?</b></p>
<li>
Copyleft states that any modifications (new versions) of free software made by other authors have to remain free. Copyright restricts the use and distribution of certain software product.
</li>
<br>
  <p><b>7. Explain what a shrink-wrap license is.</b></p>
  <li>
  <b>Shrink wrap contracts</b> are license agreements or other terms and conditions of a (putatively) contractual nature which can be read and accepted by the consumer only after the consumer opens the product. The term refers to the shrinkwrap plastic wrapping used to coat software boxes, because such packaging makes it impossible for the buyer to have read the contract before completing the purchase. These contracts are not, however, limited to the software industry. (Wikipedia)
