  <ul>
    <li>A trademark is a word, name phrase, or symbol that identifies a product or service.</li>
    <li>The Lanham Act, also referred to as the Trademark Act of 1946, was passed to provide protection for registered trademarks.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The Act intends to ensure that the quality associated with a certain logo or symbol used by a business actually represents the quality that consumers expect (e.g., the BMW label).</li>
    </ul>
    <li>To qualify for a trademark, the "mark" or name is supposed to be distinctive.</li>
    <li>However, Deborah Halbert (1999) notes that a trademark for "uh-huh" was granted to Pepsi.</li>
    <li>Also, consider that a major movie theatre in the U.S. has trademarked the expression “Silence is Golden.”</li>
