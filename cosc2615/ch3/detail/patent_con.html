􏰀  <ul>
    <li>A patent is a form of legal protection given to individuals who create an invention or process.</li>
    <li>Unlike copyrights, patents offer a 20-year exclusive monopoly over an expression or implementation of a protected work.</li>
    <li>The present US patent statute is based on the Patent Act of 1952, as amended in 1995.</li>
    <li>Patent protection can be applied to inventions and discoveries that include utilitarian or functional devices such as machines, articles of manufacture, or "compositions of matter.“</li>
    <li>Patents are granted to inventions and discoveries that satisfy three conditions:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>usefulness,</li>
      <li>novelty,</li>
      <li>non-obviousness.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Computer hardware inventions clearly satisfied the requirements of patent law.</li>
    <li>Computer software did not (initially).</li>
    <li>Beginning with Gotshalk v. Benson (1972), the US Patent Office and the courts established a strong opposition to patents.</li>
    <li>Benson applied for a patent for an algorithm he developed that translated the representation of numbers from base 10 to base 2.</li>
