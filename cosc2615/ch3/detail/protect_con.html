    <h3 class="modal-title">The Case for Protecting Software as a form of Intellectual Property</h3>
</div>
<div class="modal-body modal-fixed-height">
  <ul>
    <li> The software industry has made the following kind of argument for why software should be protected with intellectual property rights.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>PREMISE 1. Stealing a tangible object is morally wrong.</li>
      <li>􏰀PREMISE 2. Making an unauthorized copy of proprietary software is identical to stealing a tangible object.</li>
      <li>CONCLUSION. Making unauthorized copies of proprietary software is morally wrong.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>If we apply the rules for logical validity (examined in Chapter 3), we see that this argument is valid because of its logical form.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Consider that if both Premises 1 and 2 are assumed true, the conclusion cannot be false.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Even though the argument’s form is valid, we could still show the argument to be unsound if either or both of the premises are false.</li>
    <li>Premise 1 (in the above argument) is fairly straightforward, and few would question its truth.</li>
    <li>But Premise 2 is more controversial and thus we can question whether it is empirically true.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>E.g., is duplicating a software program identical to stealing a physical item?</li>
      <li>Software programs, like other intellectual objects are nonexclusionary, so my having a copy of Program X does not exclude you having a copy of that program, and vice versa.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Because the truth of Premise 2 is questionable, we cannot infer that the above argument is sound.</li>
    <li>But even if the original argument turns out to be unsound, it does not follow that its conclusion – “Making unauthorized copies of proprietary software is morally wrong” – is false. For example:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The conclusion could be true for reasons other than those stated in the original argument’s premises.</li>
      <li>Even if duplicating software is not identical to stealing physical property, we might show that it could cause harm.</li>
      <li>Consider that copying the proprietary software program, like the theft of someone’s physical property, deprives the property owner of the legitimate use of his or her property.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>One could also argue, for example, that unauthorized copying is harmful because it is a misuse, misappropriation, or “unfair taking” of another person’s property against the property owner’s will (Spinello, 2008) .</li>
    <li>So, there could be alternative reasons why the original argument’s conclusion can be true, despite the fact that its second premise may be false.</li>
  </ul>

  􏰀  <h4>Property as a Form of “Control”</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>􏰀X (as the owner of property Y) can control Y relative to persons A, B, C, and so forth.</li>
      <li>If Harry owns a certain object (e.g. a Toshiba
      laptop computer), then Harry can control who
      has access to that object and how it is used.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>􏰀For example, Harry has the right to exclude Sally from using the laptop computer; or he could grant her unlimited access
        to that computer.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Ownership claims involving "intellectual objects" are both similar to and different from ownership of tangible objects.</li>

    </ul>
