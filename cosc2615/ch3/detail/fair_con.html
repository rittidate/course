  􏰀  <ul>
      <li>The principle of fair use balances the exclusive controls given to copyright holders against the broader interests of society.</li>
      <li>􏰀Fair use means that an author or publisher may make limited use of another person's copyrighted work for purposes such as:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>􏰀criticism,</li>
        <li>comment,</li>
        <li>teaching,</li>
        <li>scholarship,</li>
        <li>research.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>The fair-use principle has also supported the practice of "reverse engineering."</li>
      <li>Reverse engineering is very important in the computer industry in particular, and in engineering in general, because it allows someone to buy a product for the purpose of taking it apart to see how it works.</li>
