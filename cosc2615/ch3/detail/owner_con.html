<div class="modal-body modal-fixed-height">
􏰀  <ul>
    <li>Legally, one cannot own an idea in the same sense that one can own a physical object.</li>
    <li>􏰀Governments do not grant ownership rights to individuals for ideas per se.</li>
    <li>􏰀Legal protection is given only to the tangible expression of an idea that is creative or original.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Ideas vs. Expressions of Ideas</h4>
􏰀 <ul>
      <li>If an idea is literary or artistic in nature, it must be expressed (or "fixed") in some tangible medium in order to be protected.</li>
    􏰀 <li>A “tangible medium” could be a physical book or a sheet of paper containing a musical score.</li>
    􏰀 <li>If the idea is functional in nature, such as an invention, it must be expressed in terms of a machine or a process.</li>
    􏰀 <li>Authors are granted copyright protections for expressions of their literary ideas, while inventors are given patent protection for their inventions.</li>
