􏰀  <h4>Property as a “Relational” Concept</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Property should not be viewed simply in terms of items or things.</li>
    <li>Philosophers and legal theorists point out that
    property also describes relationship between
    individuals in reference to things.</li>
    <li>They also note that three elements need to be considered:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>(i) an individual (X ),</li>
      <li>(ii) an object (Y),</li>
      <li>(iii) X's relation to other individuals (A, B, C, etc.) in reference to Y.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <br>
  􏰀  <h4>Property as a Form of “Control”</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>􏰀X (as the owner of property Y) can control Y relative to persons A, B, C, and so forth.</li>
      <li>If Harry owns a certain object (e.g. a Toshiba
      laptop computer), then Harry can control who
      has access to that object and how it is used.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>􏰀For example, Harry has the right to exclude Sally from using the laptop computer; or he could grant her unlimited access
        to that computer.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Ownership claims involving "intellectual objects" are both similar to and different from ownership of tangible objects.</li>

    </ul>
