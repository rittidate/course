􏰀  <ul>
    <li>Benson’s algorithm is an important feature of all programs.</li>
    <li>If granted a patent for his algorithm, Benson would have controlled almost every computer in use for 12 years.</li>
    <li>The patent was denied to Benson on the basis of a policy that bars patents for mere mathematical formulas or abstract processes that can be performed by a series of "mental steps" with the aid of pencil and paper.</li>
