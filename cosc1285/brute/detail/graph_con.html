  <li>A graph G is directed if all of the pairs of vertices in E have an ordering imposed.</li>
  <li>A graph G with every pair of its vertices connected by an edge is called complete, often denoted K|V|.</li>
  <li>The degree of a vertex is the number of incident edges of the vertex.</li>

  <li>The length of a path is the total number of vertices in a vertex sequence defining its path minus one, which is the same as the number of edges in the path.</li>
  <li>A graph is said to be connected if for every pair of vertices u and v there is a path from u to v.</li>
