  Bubble sort is another application of a brute force. In the algorithm, adjacent elements of the list are compared and are exchanged if they are out of order.

<pre>
  Algorithm <b>BubbleSort</b> (A[0..n-1])
  <b>for</b> i ← 0 to  n-2 do
  	<b>for</b> j ← 0 to n – 2 – i do
  		<b>if</b> A[j+1] < A[j]
         <b>swap</b> A[j] and A[j+1]
</pre>

<p>
  The basic operation of the bubble sort is comparison - A[j+1] < A[j] and swapping - swap A[j] and A[j+1].
  The number of key comparisons is the same for all arrays of size n and it is Θ(n<sup>2</sup>). However, the number of key swaps depends on the input and in the worst case is Θ(n<sup>2</sup>).
  The above implementation of Bubble sort can be slightly improved if we stop the execution of the algorithm when a pass through the list makes no exchanges (i.e. indicating that the list has been sorted).
  Thus, in the best case the complexity will be Θ(n) and the worst case Θ(n<sup>2</sup>).
