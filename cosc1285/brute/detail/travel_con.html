<p>
  Given a collection of n cities and the distance (or cost to travel) between each of them, find the shortest (cheapest) path of visiting all the cities exactly once, and returning to the starting point.

<ul>
<li>The problem statement is deceptively simple, the solution is not.</li>
<li>A polynomial solution to this problem would settle the most important open problem in computer science, the P vs NP problem, and could net you 1,000,000 dollars from the Clay mathematics institute!</li>
<li>One of the most intensely studied problems in computational mathematics.</li>
<li>The problem of finding the shortest Hamiltonian circuit in a weighted connected graph can be reduced to this problem.</li>
</ul>

  <li>The first step of the solution for this problem is to calculate the number of tours through n cities.</li>
  <li>There are <b>(n âˆ’ 1)!/2</b> tours assuming the direction of the tour is not important (which we did not do in the simplest solution).</li>
  <li>To get a feel for how big the search space is for even small values of n, see <a href="http://www.tsp.gatech.edu/problem/pcb3cnt.html">http://www.tsp.gatech.edu/problem/pcb3cnt.html</a></li>
