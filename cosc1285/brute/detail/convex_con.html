  The Convex-hull problem tries to find the smallest convex polygon enclosing n points on the plane (i.e. find the points that will serve as vertexes to the polygon).
</p>
<ul>
There are some definitions that need to be made for this problem:
<li> 1. Convex set: For any two points P and Q in the set, the entire line segment with the end points at P and Q belongs to the set</li>
<li>2. Convex hull of a set S of points is the smallest convex set containing S</li>
</ul>
<p>
The convex hull of any set S of n > 2 points is a convex polygon with the vertexes at some of the points of S.
</p>
<p>
In the implementation of the problem, for each pair of points p1 and p2, a brute force algorithm determines whether all other points lie to the same side of a straight line through p1 and p2. If so, the line segment connecting p1 and p2 is a part of the convex hull’s boundary.
</p>
<pre>
Algorithm:
for each of n(n-1)/2 pairs of distinct points
for each of the other n – 2 points
find the sign of ax + by – c
</pre>
<p>
The time efficiency of this algorithm is O(n<sup>3</sup>).
