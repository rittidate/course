  <li>At the first level, we spend cn time</li>
  <li>At the second level, we spend cn/2 on each subproblem, for a total of cn time.</li>
  <li>At level j of the recursion, the number of problems has doubled j times. Each problem costs n/2j . Therefore, level j contributes at most 2j (cn/2j ) = cn time.</li>
  <li>Summing across all the levels (of which there are log2 n), we get a total running time of Î˜(n log n).</li>
